<h2>Instructions</h2>
<h4>LED Assembly</h4>
<p>First, we will assemble the LED and the LED holder. Use the larger washers and nuts (2 largers, 1 smaller of each). Get out your LED holder mounts and the parts (nut and washer) you see in the image along with the colored or clear LEDs. Assemble according to the images shows. Slip the clear plastic piece shown onto the LED. Next, slide the LED and the plastic piece, still on the bottom of LED, through the bottom of the metal LED holder mount. Note, the LED is inserted into the back of the metal LED holder. </p>

<p>Place the LED system you created into one of the 2 drilled holes on the top of the Altoids tin. Repeat with other LED system. Slide the washer onto the LED holder mount(from the inside) and screw on the nut after placing the washer. Repeat on other LED holder mount configuration.</p>

<h4>Wiring Assembly</h4>
<p>This project uses a breadboard to connect most of the wiring. The breadboard supplied with your kit has five metal strips inside of it that are connected vertically only (see image below).</p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with what a breadboard is, we recommend you take a moment to check out the description offered by MakeUseOf (https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-breadboard/).</p>
<p>For our wiring setup, we're aiming for the layout you can see in the image below. However, there are many other viable options for making your Altoids flashlight. We encourage you to experiment with other layouts to better understand how the project works.</p>

<p>Take the breadboard and place the wires of the 9V battery clip connecter. Red, in the 1st (farthest from numbers) hole in the column to the right of the 3rd column. Black, in the 1st hole in the column to the left of the 1st column.</p>

<p>Put one of the wires on the micro push button switch into the the hole behind the red wire and and the other in the middle hole of the 3rd column (as printed at bottom of breadboard.</p>
